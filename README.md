README for Introduction to Image Processing and Computer Vision project 2 
Using different image features in order to classify different types of leaves  
  
In helper.py we can set different settings and then execute global_features*.py as well as train_test.py to obtained results for our changed data & features to use.  
  
Aim - elaboration of discriminative feature vector. We want to learn different classes of leaves based on different features we choose so that we are able to distinguish between leaves of different, learned species.  

The output is just the obtained statistics. Both box plot and text versions.

ML scripts mostly based on [Image Classification using Python and Scikit-learn by Gogul09](https://gogul.dev/software/image-classification-python)
